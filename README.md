# Enterprise-IT-Infrastructure-Lab

**Objective:**
Build a production-style enterprise network in a virtual lab using Windows Server and Linux

**Technologies Used**
VMware Workstation, Windows Server 2022, Active Directory Domain Services, DNS, DHCP, Group Policy, Ubuntu Server (Kerberos + SSSD), NTFS/SMB file sharing, Windows Backup, Event Viewer, Audit logging


**Architecture**

**Features Implemented**
Domain Controller deployment
DNS + DHCP configuration
Organizational Units + Users + Groups
Group Policy access control
Role-based file permissions
Windows client domain join
Ubuntu AD integration
Security logging & auditing
Backup + restore validation

### 🔧 Challenge 1 — VM Networking Not Working
S — Situation
I deployed multiple VMs (Windows Server, Windows 10, Ubuntu), but they couldn’t communicate or access the internet.
T — Task
Ensure all machines could talk to each other internally and Ubuntu could reach the internet to install required packages.
A — Action
Configured two VM networks:
•	Host-Only → internal LAN for AD communication
•	NAT → external internet access
R — Result
All machines communicated properly, Ubuntu downloaded packages, and I continued building the domain environment successfully.

**Challenge 2 — DNS Prevented Domain Join**
S — Situation
Windows and Ubuntu repeatedly failed to join the domain due to DNS errors like SERVFAIL and “No such realm found”.
T — Task
Fix name resolution so both systems could locate the domain controller.
A — Action
•	Set 192.168.10.10 (Domain Controller) as DNS on all machines
•	Updated netplan and /etc/resolv.conf in Ubuntu
•	Restarted SSSD and network services
R — Result
Both the Windows client and Ubuntu successfully joined the domain and authenticated users.

### 🎯 Project Outcome
This project helped me understand how enterprise systems integrate—Active Directory, file security, identity management, networking, logging, and Linux–Windows authentication.

It also strengthened my troubleshooting skills across DNS, network routing, and authentication services.
